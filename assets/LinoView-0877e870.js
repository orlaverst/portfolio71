I also experimented with putting the ink on glass after which I pressed the lino on and then printed the glass on the paper. This led to a reversed effect of the linocut and a mirrored image compared to the other prints. </p></div><div class="text-black"><div class="font-title text-lg mb-3"><p>ILLUSTRATION &amp; LINOCUT</p></div><div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4 pb-6"><div><img class="h-auto max-w-full" src="'+n+'"></div><div><img class="h-auto max-w-full" src="'+r+'"></div></div></div><div class="text-black"><div class="font-title text-lg mb-3"><p>PRINTS</p></div><div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4 pb-6"><div><img class="h-auto max-w-full" src="'+c+'"></div><div><img class="h-auto max-w-full" src="'+d+'"></div><div><img class="h-auto max-w-full" src="'+p+'"></div><div><img class="h-auto max-w-full" src="'+h+'"></div></div><div><p class="font-text text-black">I really like the sort of moldy texture that appears on the prints.
