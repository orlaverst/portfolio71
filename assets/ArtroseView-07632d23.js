Starting from nothing but an existing alphabet was really intimidating. While doing further research I stumbled upon modular fonts whereby each letter or symbol is formed with the same shapes. This gave me a direction of how to start and to build my own font. Of course this made a font that is unusable for a continious text. <br> I later on chose to call it ‘Arthrosis’ because while talking about it with some friends, someone reconised that all the modular elements kind of looked like bones and after looking again I couldn’t un see it. After I made the font I used it on a poster and it was used in an expo as title. </p></div><div><div class="font-title text-lg mb-3"><p>FONT &amp; MODULAR ELEMENTS</p></div><div class=""><img class="maw-w-full h-auto" src="'+c+'"></div><div class="mb-6"><p class="font-text text-black italic text-center"> Arthrosis, the font with in the right corner the 6 elements used to build each letter.</p></div></div><div><div class="font-title text-lg mb-3"><p>USE</p></div><div class="pb-3 flex justify-center items-center"><img class="h-screen w-auto" src="'+r+'"></div><div class="mb-6"><p class="font-text text-black italic text-center"> Additionally I created a poster with the font that I then printed with a riso printer. </p></div><div class="pb-3"><img class="maw-w-full h-auto" src="'+d+'"></div><div class=""><p class="font-text text-black italic text-center"> Arthrosis used as the title font for another project in an expo. </p></div></div>',7),v={__name:"ArtroseView",setup(f){return(m,u)=>(e(),s("main",null,[t(i),a("div",p,[h,t(n)])]))}};export{v as default};
